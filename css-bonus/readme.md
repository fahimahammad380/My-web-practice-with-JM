CSS positon:
    static, absolute, fixted, relative, sticky and so many

     Exception is absolute and relative.

        Absolute: will lose its space and will be placed on another element. If we set its positioning properties (let, right, top and bottom) it will calculate, reference to its parent.

        Relative: will not lose its space
